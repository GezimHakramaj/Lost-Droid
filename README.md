# Lost Droid
## Intro to Game Programming CISC 3660 project


This is a small project us three have developed together using Unity, C# and free assests on the Unity Asset Store.

The game is simple! You are a lost android in space. Avoid the debris hurling towards you at any cost and survive for as long as you can!
