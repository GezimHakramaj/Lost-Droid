# Lost Droid
## Intro to Game Programming CISC 3660 project

This is a small project us three have developed together using Unity, C# and free assests on the Unity Asset Store.

The game is simple! You are a lost android in space. Avoid the debris hurling towards you at any cost and survive for as long as you can!

### Lore
In 2030, NASA has successfully discovered a wormhole that connects the Milky Way Galaxy to a galaxy millions of lightyears away, named GardenOfEden-012. Probes have discovered over a dozen planets like Earth. NASA believes that these planets can sustain life. However, human astronauts cannot safely make the trip into the wormhole and the probes cannot send information back once they’ve entered the atmosphere of these planets. In response NASA began Project Robot L. Robot L would be the first android created with a human consciousness uploaded into its programming. If successful, he would be the most advanced artificial intelligence being in existence. In 2035, Project Robot L was successfully completed. Robot L was placed on a small shuttle and launched into the wormhole with a mission to land on the nearest planet to the wormhole exit. The mission went south as the shuttle entered an asteroid field upon exiting the wormhole. The shuttle was destroyed but the droid survived. Now the droid is flying through space while dodging pieces of the wreckage and the asteroids.
